[rows,columns]= size(processed_data)
for i=1:rows
 
  peak_demand=max(processed_data( (i-1)*24+1: (i-1)*24+24));
  
end

This gave a single number as output




I also tried this:

for i=1:length(processed_data)
  
  peak_demand=max(processed_data( (i-1)*24+1: (i-1)*24+24));
  
end

Which gave output "Index exceeds matrix dimensions"



I also switched "max" with "findpeaks" and got the same output

With solely the "findpeaks" function, I got an output of a 1x715 vector
